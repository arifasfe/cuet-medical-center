# CUET Medical Center Web Application

This project showcases a demo web application designed and developed for the Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET) Medical Center as part of the "Software Engineering (sessional)" course. The primary objective was to implement an E-Booklet system for students, aiming to improve accessibility and streamline information delivery.

## Technology Stack

**Frontend:** ReactJS was chosen for building the frontend to provide a dynamic and intuitive user experience. This enabled features like:

* Responsive design for seamless access across devices
* Interactive elements for engaging user interaction
* Rich UI components for clear information presentation

**Backend:** Django, a robust and secure Python framework, powers the backend APIs. This ensures:

* Scalable architecture to accommodate future growth
* RESTful API design for seamless integration with the frontend
* User authentication and authorization for secure data access

## Key Features

* **Introducing E-Booklet System:** Students can access their E-Booklet instead of physical booklet.
* **Search and Filter:** Quickly find relevant E-Booklets using keyword search and filter options for the admins.
* **Roster:** Digitalized roster system for the doctors
## Project Goals

* Enhance accessibility of E-booklett for CUET Medical Center students.
* Improve efficiency in information delivery and retrieval.
* Offer a platform for continuous improvement and feature expansion.

## Current State

This repository primarily serves as a showcase of the project concept and its implementation details.
